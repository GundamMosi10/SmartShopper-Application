# SmartShopper Application

## Description
SmartShopper is a price comparison website that takes a user search and returns the top listing from two of the most popular marketplaces on the web - Amazon and Ebay. The user is presented with a photo from each listing, the name, price and rating on the respective marketplaces as well as a description from the Amazon listing(eBay descriptions are not provided as they are user generated since it is auction based). The site focuses on simplicity prompting users to search while displaying the logos and a placeholder image telling the user where their information will be displayed.

## Background
Amazon and Ebay are two of the largest global market places with 213 million and 182 million unique users respectively.
